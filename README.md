# Perceptual (Headphones) Equaliser

WARNING: Clipping can occur when the Amplitude slider is moved past the red indicator.
This can damage your speakers and when played at high volume. (If you happen to use this tool on loudspeakers).

This tool a much simplified variant of David Griesinger's [DGSonicFocus](http://www.davidgriesinger.com/) application

This version outputs an error file that you can import into [Room EQ Wizard](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) to create an 
equaliser definition, as you would from a calibration measurement.
