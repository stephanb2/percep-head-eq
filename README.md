# Perceptual (Headphones) Equaliser

WARNING: Clipping can occur when the amplitude slider is moved past the red bar.
This can damage your speakers and your hearing when played at high volume.

This tool is a much simplified variant of David Griesinger's [DGSonicFocus](http://www.davidgriesinger.com/) application.

This version outputs an error file that you can import into [Room EQ Wizard](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) to create an equaliser definition, as you would from a speaker/room response measurement.
